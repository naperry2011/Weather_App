# Weather App with Integrated Features

## Project Overview
This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for a comprehensive weather application that integrates multiple productivity features including weather forecasting, task management, scheduling, reminders, alarms, and theme switching capabilities.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend will be built using React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. Key architectural decisions include:

#### Core Components
- Weather Display Module
  - Current weather conditions
  - Hourly forecast
  - 5-day forecast
  - Weather alerts
  - Location management

- Task Management System
  - To-do list with CRUD operations
  - Task categorization
  - Priority levels
  - Due dates integration
  - Progress tracking

- Schedule Manager
  - Calendar view
  - Event creation and editing
  - Recurring events
  - Schedule conflicts detection
  - Integration with weather data

- Reminder System (3-Tier)
  - High priority (Red): Immediate attention required
  - Medium priority (Yellow): Important but not urgent
  - Low priority (Green): General reminders
  - Push notification support
  - Custom reminder intervals

- Alarm System
  - Multiple alarm support
  - Custom sound selection
  - Snooze functionality
  - Weather-based smart wake-up
  - Gradual volume increase

- Theme Controller
  - Automatic day/night detection
  - Manual override option
  - Custom theme creation
  - Accessibility considerations

### Backend Architecture

#### API Layer
- Weather Data Integration
  - Third-party weather API integration
  - Data caching strategy
  - Rate limiting implementation
  - Error handling

- User Management
  - Authentication system
  - User preferences storage
  - Data synchronization
  - Profile management

#### Database Schema
- Users
- Tasks
- Events
- Reminders
- Alarms
- Settings
- Weather Cache

### Security Considerations
- JWT authentication
- HTTPS implementation
- Rate limiting
- Data encryption
- Input validation
- CORS policies

## Technical Requirements

### Development Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

### External Dependencies
- Weather API service
- Push notification service
- Cloud hosting platform
- Email service provider
- Map service integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Weather Features
- Basic weather display
- Location management
- Weather API integration
- Basic UI implementation

### Phase 2: Productivity Features
- To-do list implementation
- Basic scheduler
- Simple reminder system
- Basic alarm functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- 3-tier reminder system
- Advanced scheduling
- Smart alarms
- Theme system
- Weather alerts

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
- Feature integration
- Performance optimization
- UI/UX improvements
- Testing & bug fixes

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading implementation
- Image optimization
- API response caching
- Database query optimization
- Client-side state management

## Maintenance Plan
- Regular security updates
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback integration
- Feature updates
- Bug tracking and resolution

## Future Enhancements
